## Data Stuctures:
1. Segment Tree Recursive - Recursive Implementaion of Segment tree without lazy propagation.O(nlog(n)) building , O(log(n)) query.
2. Sparse Table for RMQ - Solves static RMQ problem (range minimum/maximum query without element changes) in O(nlogn) building, O(1) query for RMQ but can be O(log(n)) for other funtions.

## Graph Algorithms:
1. Floyd-Warshall - Floyd-Warshall algorithm finding shortest distance between all pairs of vertices in graph in O(n^3).
2. Kruskal MST - Kruskal  algorithm  for finding Minimum spannig Tree in graph using DSU in O(Mlog(N)).

## String Algorithms:
1. Z_function - Calculating the Z-function of the given string in O(n).
2. Prefix function -O(n), pi[i] is the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring str[0…i] which is also a suffix of this substring str[0…i] O(n).
